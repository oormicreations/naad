        Naad supports selection, cut, copy,&nbsp;paste and deletion of a group of Bols 
			or Loops. This makes compositing easier and faster.
    </p>
    <p>
        By default the views are set to <strong><em>Compose Mode</em></strong>. To enter 
			the <strong><em>Edit Mode</em></strong>, click on menu <strong><em>Edit-&gt;Select</em></strong>. 
			Now you can do the edit operations. To end the edit mode click <strong><em>Edit-&gt;Select</em></strong>
        again.
    </p>
    <p>The current mode is displayed on the grid header.</p>

    <p><strong>Editing in Loop View</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>Enter the edit mode by clicking <strong><em>Edit-&gt;Select</em></strong>
        on the menu.
			<li>
        Click on the boxes one by one, as many as you want. They will be highlighted 
			with orange color.
			<li>Click <strong><em>Edit-&gt;Copy</em></strong>
        to copy the boxes.
			<li>Select an empty box and click <strong><em>Edit-&gt;Paste</em></strong> to paste 
				the boxes.
				<ul>
                    <li>
                    The relative positions of the boxes&nbsp;are maintained.
					<li>
                    Pasting on an existing box will overwrite it.
					<li>
                    Paste as many times as you want.
					<li>
                    Paste also works in Compose Mode.
					<li>
                    To paste the Bols of one loop into another loop, copy the boxes, end the edit 
					mode, switch to composition mode, open another loop, select a box and paste 
					there.
					<li>Pasting the Bols in Composition View will create a new loop with the copied 
						contents.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>To move the contents, use the <strong><em>Edit-&gt;Cut</em></strong> and <strong><em>Edit-&gt;Paste</em></strong>
        commands.
			<li>To delete the selected Bols, use <strong><em>Edit-&gt;Clear</em></strong>.
			<li>To end the edit mode click <strong><em>Edit-&gt;Select</em></strong> again.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p><strong>Editing in Composition View.</strong></p>
    <p>
        The procedure is exactly like that of Loop View. You can copy-paste many loops 
			at a time. Pasting a Loop in Loop View will result in pasting of its all Bols 
			there. (If many Loops were copied only the Bols of first Loop shall be pasted 
			in this case.)
    </p>
    <p>
        As in case of Bols, the relative positions of the Loops&nbsp;are maintained. 
			Ensure that you select a location for pasting which provides enough room so 
			that no Loops are overwritten.
    </p>

    <p><strong>Adding of Bols to existing Bols</strong></p>
    <p>In order to simulate hitting of both the drums at the same time, one can add an extra bol to the existing one.</p>
    <p>This also gives the effect of two Tablas playing at the same time, if all bols are appended with an extra and a different varient is used for the extra.</p>
    <p>To add a bol to the existing one, click <strong><em>Edit-&gt;Add</em></strong> and click the bol to set additional bol at the same place.</p>
    <p>Click <strong><em>Edit-&gt;Add</em></strong> again to come back to compose mode.</p>
