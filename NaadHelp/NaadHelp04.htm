		&nbsp;
		<P></P>
		<P>Naad provides controls for varying the Tempo, Bols, and&nbsp;Randomness etc. 
			These enhance the creativity and usefulness of the program.</P>

		<P><STRONG>Composition Tools</STRONG></P>
		<P><IMG alt="" src="HelpImages\CompTools01.gif"></P>
		<P>1. Auto Compose will compose an Indian classical solo of Tabla in a single 
			click. This tool is under construction and at this time it only creates some 
			empty loops as placeholders.</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P>

		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P><STRONG>Tempo Control</STRONG></P>
		<P><IMG alt="" src="HelpImages\TempoControl01.gif"></P>
		<P>This slider increments or decrements the tempo or <STRONG><EM>Gati</EM></STRONG>. 
			The Gati is actually number of Maatras per minute. Do not confuse it with 
			number of Bols per minute. If there are many Bols in the Maatra they are 
			speeded up or slowed down so that the Maatra completes in specified time.</P>
		<P>The changes are applied to the Loop Tempo as specified in the Loop properties. 
			The changes are shown as <STRONG><EM>Deviation</EM></STRONG> below the slider, 
			along with the original tempo and the resulting tempo.</P>
		<P><STRONG><EM>Vilambit</EM></STRONG> is slow, <STRONG><EM>Madhya</EM></STRONG> is 
			medium and <STRONG><EM>Drut</EM></STRONG> is fast. The button marked <STRONG><EM>1 X</EM></STRONG>
			cycles through 1X, 2X, 3X, 4X, 1/4X, 1/3X, 1/2X and 1X of the tempo on each 
			click. This is used to quickly set the tempo to integral multiples or divisions 
			of the original.</P>
		<P>Changes in tempo using Tempo Control are temporary and are not saved with the 
			composition. To make the tempo setting permanent, edit the Loop properties.</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>

		<P><STRONG>Accompaniments</STRONG></P>
		<P><IMG alt="" src="HelpImages\Acc01.gif"></P>
		<P>Accompaniments are instruments played along with the composition. You can either 
			specify an accompaniment for the Loop in Loop properties or for the entire 
			composition.
		</P>
		<P>Checking the <STRONG><EM>Ghungru at Sam</EM></STRONG> checkbox will enable 
			playing Ghungru right at the Bol marked as Sam. This is useful for keeping 
			track of the <STRONG><EM>Taal</EM></STRONG>. A few varieties of Ghungrus are 
			available from menu <STRONG><EM>Accompaniment -&gt; Ghungru</EM></STRONG>.</P>

		<P><STRONG>Timing Variation and Randomness</STRONG></P>
		<P><IMG alt="" src="HelpImages\TempoVar01.gif"></P>
		<P>This slider, if set at a value other than zero, will introduce a slight random 
			variation in the tempo. This makes the Tabla a bit more natural to ears. It 
			goes from <STRONG><EM>Too Perfect</EM></STRONG> for a master player to <STRONG><EM>Imperfect</EM></STRONG>
			for a novice player effect.</P>
		<P>&nbsp;</P>

			<HR width="100%" color="#000099" SIZE="3">
		<P>&nbsp;</P>
		<P><STRONG>Bol Variety</STRONG></P>
		<P>
			Naad can introduce a variation in Bols during play in real time, just like a 
			Tabla player improvising on his/her composition during a performance. This 
			gives rise to interesting <STRONG><EM>Variants</EM></STRONG> (<STRONG><EM>Prakar</EM></STRONG>) 
			just by sliding this slider.</P>
		<P>The variant status is shown on the grid header.</P>
		<P><IMG alt="" src="HelpImages\BolVar01.gif"></P>
		<OL>
			<LI>
				The slider introduces&nbsp;a new&nbsp;variation on each adjustment.
				<UL>
					<LI>
					At zero position the original is played.
					<LI>
					As you go from Narrow to Medium to Wide, the deviation from the original 
					increases.
					<LI>
					To play the original, click the Play button anytime.
					<LI>
						Works only while playing.</LI></UL>
			<LI>
			Checking this box will affect the entire composition and all Loops are varied.
			<LI>
				Checking this box will force the varient to be restricted within the Bol 
				species. So a Bol <EM>Na01</EM> will be changed to anything from <EM>Na01 to Na10</EM>, 
			but not to any other species.
			<LI>
			Checking this box will force the variant to be restricted to the currently 
			opened loop. The rest of the composition is unaffected.
			<LI>
			Checking this box will result in a varient with the Bols totally changed to any 
			species, completely changing the Loop.
			<LI>
				Click this button to replace the original with the variant, if you 
				find&nbsp;the variant&nbsp;interesting. The change is permanent after clicking 
				this button and the original is lost. So make sure you save your composition 
				before clicking this button.</LI></OL>
